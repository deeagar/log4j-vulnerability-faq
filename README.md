# log4j-vulnerability-faq


### What is Log4j?
[Log4J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4j) is a widely used Java library for logging messages in applications. 

### What is this vulnerability all about?
The one with the best explanation I found so far is on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyq8yxWO1ls) by [Java Brains](https://javabrains.io/)

### Why Java allows such RCE in first place?

### Give me a live example of demonstrating this vulnerability in action please.

### Should using the String.Format (or string interpolation) should be discouraged due to this?

### Is there any equivalent JNDI component in .Net?  

### Doesn't .Net applications also uses such lookup mechanism?

### Even without Log4j, I could use the JNDI component. So why the vulnerability is only attributed to Log4j?

### Is my current Java/.Net etc. application affected by this?

### Does .Net also allows RCE?
